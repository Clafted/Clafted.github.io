                    <p>This project (along with other projects, but this one especially) brings good memories.
                        When I first began developing NoiseGenerator, I was diving into the realm of 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation"><strong>procedural generation</strong></a>, 
                        specifically, procedural map generation. Popular games like <em>Minecraft</em> use it, 
                        so I, in pursuit of experience in Game-Development, thought of implementing a procedural-generation algorithm. 
                        <br><br>
                        Algorithms like such utilize "noise", <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin Noise</a>, 
                        most recognizably, so I prioritized developing that algorithm. Development involved a lot 
                        of time researching how the algorithm works, as I read online articles, watched Youtube videos, 
                        and scoured through Stack Ovoerflow in order to realize how my algorithm should work.
                        <br><br>
                        It got to the point that I started working on this project during breaks at school. 
                        Some of my friends would pass by and I would tell them about it. Checking in occasionally,
                        they would see how development was going, and I would have the chance to explain what 
                        the program did and why I was doing it. Unsurprisingly, this developed my own 
                        understanding, now that I had to put the abstract knowledge into words.
                        <br><br>
                        This project, being both an opportunity to learn and to connect, is important to me, for 
                        that exact reason; the project brought about fond memories to me.
                        <br><br>
                        The photos below are samples resulting from the library, along with tweaking of certain colors. 
                        "output" is a basic example of procedural map generation, as it uses Perlin Noise 
                        along with parameters to determine what "biome" (presented with colors) the area would be. 
                        Green -> Grass, Blue -> Water, Grey -> Stone, White -> Snow. The data for the photo is all 
                        floating-point numbers, but when you turn them into familiar colors, they can easiliy represent 
                        a full map. I enjoy graphics so much ;-;
